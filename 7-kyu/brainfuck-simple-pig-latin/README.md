Time to make a Pig Latin algorithm! But this time write it in brainfuck!  

The rules have been dumbed down a bit, so you'll receive no punction marks.  
In this version of Pig Latin you just have to move the first symbol to the end, and add 'ay'.  

The input guaranteed to be non-empty.

## Example: 
```
Pig --> igPay  
123456789 --> 234567891ay  
```

Note: `'a' = 97` and `'y' = 121`

Have Fun :D
