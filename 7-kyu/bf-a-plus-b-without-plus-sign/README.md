Write a program in BrainFuck to calculate `A + B`,,

So simple, right? But you have to done this with a condition that '***No plus sign in your code***'.

### Input: 
Integers A and B, as charcode from 0 to 127 (`0 <= A,B <= 127`)

### Output:
Result of `A + B` with ***No plus sign in your code***

### Example:
#### Input: A=88, B=33 `X!`
#### Output: A+B=121 `y`
```brainfuck
 X + !  =  y
88 + 33 = 121
```
