### Task
You will be given two words (each word contains only letters [a-z, A-Z]) seperated by comma (,).

Write a program in BrainFuck to compare those two words. The result is 'true' if two strings are equal, otherwise result is 'false'.

### Input
Two words seperated by comma. (They can be different length.)

Each word contains letters [a-z, A-Z], and its length not longer than 10 characters. (`1<= length <= 10`)

The input will be terminated with a null character for EOF.

### Output
Return `true` if two words are equal, otherwise `false`.

### Example
#### Input: `abc,ABC`
#### Output: 'abc' != 'ABC' `false`
